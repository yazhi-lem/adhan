# Adhan - The Tamil First

## From Aadhaan to Adhan: A Renaming Story

### The Origin

The name **"Adhan"** (ஆதன்) emerges from the depths of Tamil history — from the ancient archaeological sites of **Adichanallur** (ஆதிச்சநல்லூர்) and the revolutionary excavations at **Keezhadi** (கீழடி).

### Why Adhan?

**Aadhaan** (ஆதான்) originally meant "foundation" or "basis" — a fitting name for a foundational Tamil language model.

But as we traced the roots of Tamil civilization, we found something deeper.

### The Archaeological Connection

#### Adichanallur (ஆதிச்சநல்லூர்)
- **Location:** Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu
- **Dating:** 905 BC – 696 BC (confirmed by carbon dating)
- **Significance:** One of the earliest Tamil settlements, containing urns with **Tamil-Brahmi** inscriptions — the oldest written Tamil ever discovered
- **Discovery:** 169 clay urns with human skeletons, dating back 3,800+ years

#### Keezhadi (கீழடி)
- **Location:** Sivagangai district, near Madurai
- **Dating:** 6th century BCE (Sangam era)
- **Significance:** Evidence of a sophisticated urban Tamil civilization with:
  - Ring wells (urban planning)
  - Terracotta pipes (drainage systems)
  - Baked brick structures
  - Tamil-Brahmi script on potsherds
  - Ivory dice, gold ornaments, trade goods

### The Meaning of Adhan

**ஆதன்** (Adhan) derives from:
- **ஆதி (Aadhi)** = Beginning, First, Origin
- Represents the **first word** — when Tamil was first written

> Just as the earliest Tamil words were etched on pottery at Adichanallur and Keezhadi,  
> **Adhan** aims to carry forward the legacy of the Tamil language into the AI age.
