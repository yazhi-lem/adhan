## Extracted readable excerpts (page n39)
> ...inflection and derivation with personal suffixes. In the sense of the definition of these terms, a personal form based on a noun would be called derivation, while the same would appear as inflection with the verb. To avoid this it seems better not to speak in terms of derivation and inflection about the personal suffixes in OTa. If the so-called finite verbal forms prove to have been personal verbal nouns in OTa, all the forms with pronominal suffixes could be interpreted in terms of derivation (i.e. derived from n., V. and ap.v.). We could say that in the process of dying out of the category of person with nouns, the 3rd person suffixes started to be used for all persons and remained as derivative morphemes. But the respective verbal forms were re-interpreted...

### 3.2 Tense
The tense suffixes coincide with the so-called verbal participles (v.p.) or adverbial participles. OTa did not distinguish all the tenses. It lacked a special present tense morpheme. There were two sets of tense suffixes for the past and non-past. The situation of OTa seems, however, to reflect a period when the function of the suffixes was not yet completely fixed with regard to tense.

(Discussion continues comparing verb classes and historical interpretations.)

### Past / Non-past examples (excerpt)
- Past tense : `-tu, -ttu, -ntu ; -i(n)`
- Non-past : `-yu, -pu, -ppu ; -ku, -kku`

A special position is occupied by the suffix `-um/-m` which denotes non-past; in OTa it can still take pronominal suffixes.

### 3.3 Negation
Negation markers appear with verbs and partly with appellative verbs. The markers are `-` and zero. The negative ap.b. `il, al` are used to express negation in phrases.

### 3.4 Number
This suffix seems not to have been compulsory with some types of nouns, especially abstract nouns.

### 3.5 Cases
Suffixes expressing relations were added to primary and secondary nouns. The most universal case is the Oblique case, expressed by zero, doubling of the final stop, loss of final `-m` after `-a-`, addition of `-ttu`, or addition of `-in, -an`. The Oblique case could function in place of most indirect cases.

Case markers (selected):
- Accusative: `-ai`
- Sociative: `-odu, -āl, -utan`
- Dative: `-(k)ku`
- Genitive: `-atu`
- Instrumental: `-ān, -al`
- Ablative: `-in`
- Locative: `-il, -uḷ, -kan`

(Notes: some forms have wider semantic ranges; sandhi may affect final forms.)
