<a NAME="1"></a> 1.&nbsp;
General</h2>

<p>This section
explains most common questions about Project Madurai.</p>
<a NAME="1.1"></a><b>1.1&nbsp;
What is Project Madurai ?</b>
<p>Project
Madurai is a voluntary effort to archive works in Tamil language and make
them available to everyone on the internet.</p>

<a NAME="1.2"></a><b>1.2&nbsp;
What is the purpose of Project Madurai ?</b>
<p>The main
purpose is to preserve the precious collection of Tamil literature - both
old and new, from all over the world.&nbsp; Thus, we hope through this
effort, we can build an electronic library of Tamil literature and pass
it on to generations to come.</p>
<a NAME="1.3"></a><b>1.3&nbsp;
This is a great idea.&nbsp; Who thought of this ? When did this begin ?</b>

<p>The entire
idea of this project was a collective thought of various Tamil enthusiasats.&nbsp;
In the early days of Internet (1996 onwards), several etext archiving projects
were taking place world-wide. Through various postings in the soc.culture.tamil
(usenet), tamil.net (email discussion list), many expressed the desire
to start similar projects, targetting ancient tamil literary classics.
Based on such calls in tamil.net, the project, officially started off
on Pongal/Tamil New Year day of Jan. 14, 1998!</p>
<a NAME="1.4"></a><b>1.4&nbsp;
Why should I join ?&nbsp; What do I gain ?</b>
<p>We request
you to volunteer and join in Project Madurai - to be part of a noble cause
- of preserving Tamil literature and enable the future generation enjoy
the Tamil literature.&nbsp; To quote an example - if not for U.V. Swaminatha
Iyer's work in the early 20th century, we would have lost many valuable
Tamil literature, nowadays available in print form.

<p>You gain personal
satisfaction that you contributed in a way to preserve Tamil literature.&nbsp;
(Remember the poem - 'Little drops of water, make a mighty ocean' ?)&nbsp;
Moreover, your name will be also dispalyed along with the work you volunteered
for, be it for typing-in or proof-reading.</p>
<a NAME="1.5"></a><b>1.5&nbsp;
Why was the name 'Madurai' chosen ?</b>
<p>Madurai
is one of the oldest cities of southern India. It has been a centre of
learning and pilgrimage, for centuries. Legend has it, that the divine
nectar falling from Lord Shiva's locks, gave the city its name - Madhurapuri,
now known as Madurai. Madurai's history dates back to over 2000 years ago,
when it was the capital of the Pandyan kings.
<p>It was the Pandyan
Kings during their long reigning period, who set up Sangams (academies)
for the encouragement and criticism of Tamil Studies. The Sangam period
lasting for several centuries, is considered universally as the Golden
Age of Tamil Literature. Great anthologies such as Ettuthohai and Pattupattu
were compiled and many immortals like Iraiyanar, Valluvar, Kapilar, Nakkirar,
Paranar, Auvaiyar and Ilango Adigal gave their best to the Tamil Music.
The proposed electronic text archive project devoted to tamil literature
is named after this great historic city Madurai.</p>

<a NAME="1.6"></a><b>1.6&nbsp;
Who own the electronic texts archived here ?</b>
<p>Being a
grass-root internet-based voluntary effort, the archived electronic texts
belongs to everyone.&nbsp; There is no single owner for these archives
- which can be all the more reason for you to join. This project is neither
commercial nor governmental effort.</p>
<a NAME="1.7"></a><b>1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;
I can't read these pages. What format are these pages (and electronic texts)
in ?</b>
<p>Project
Madurai electronic texts were distributed initially in Inaimathi and Mylai font encodings. <br>
Subsequently the etexts were distributed in TSCII encoding. 
Finally when Universal multilingual Unicode became available as base encoding for all <br>
three computer platforms (windows, mac and linux), we shifting to releasing all PM etexts <br>
in Unicode encoding. <br>
We have converted our earlier works from TSCII 1.7 format to Unicode/UTF-8 encoding. <br>
We apologize, in case you see some older formats still available in some webpages</p>
<a NAME="1.8"></a><b>1.8&nbsp;
Is there any listserv or egroups for this Project ?</b>
<p>Yes.&nbsp;
We do have a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pmadurai/">Project
Madurai email group</a>, where we exchange ideas.&nbsp; We recommend you
to visit the Project Madurai group in Yahoo Groups.</p>

<a NAME="1.9"></a><b>1.9&nbsp;
Who and what is a 'ProMad' ?</b>
<p>'ProMad'
is a short form for Project Madurai volunteer.&nbsp; We coined this term
 entirely for convenience.</p>


<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><a NAME="2"></a> 2.&nbsp;  Logistics</b>

<p>This section
explains the working details of Project Madurai.</p>
<a NAME="2.1"></a><b>2.1&nbsp;
How does this project work ?</b>
<p>Project
Madurai is an entirely voluntary effort.&nbsp; This means you as a volunteer
choose any Tamil work you like to archive or preferably choose one from
the target list or choose</p>
<a NAME="2.2"></a><b>2.2&nbsp;
What can I do to participate in this project ?</b>

<p>All you
have to do is - key in (any Tamil work, of your choice) or proof-read a
work already typed - in your free time.&nbsp; We have a webpage that outlines broadly target works we are aiming to cover at PM.</p>
<a NAME="2.3"></a><b>2.3&nbsp;
I like to join, but not sure if I can work regularly. Can I still contribute
?</b>
<p>As we mentioned
earlier (<a href="#1.1">Question 1.1</a>), Project Madurai is a completely

<b>voluntary</b>
effort and so we understand that you have other commitments.&nbsp; We completely
understand this and so do not compel anyone at anytime.&nbsp; So feel free
to join and contribute - during your free time and whenever you wish.</p>
<a NAME="2.4"></a><b>2.4&nbsp;
I like to type the ABCD (or any) work.&nbsp; What should I do ?</b>
<p>We are glad
to hear this.&nbsp; Before you start typing in the ABCD (any) work, please
see the <a href="pmworks.html">time-table</a> and check if this work is
already completed or in the process of being typed-in.&nbsp; If not, you
are entirely welcome to start this work - provided it is not copyrighted.&nbsp;

Send a mail to the Project Madurai group (<a href="#1.8">Question 1.8</a>)
and find out if that work can be typed-in.
<br> </p>
<a NAME="2.5"></a><b>2.5&nbsp;
How is a literature (or any Tamil work) chosen for archiving ?&nbsp; Is
there any preference ?</b>
<p>It is entirely
upto the volunteer to choose a work to add to the digital library.&nbsp;
We do not force anyone to take up any work. &nbsp; This is another good
reason<font size=-1>why you see a broad
collection of works in our collection now.

<p>No, we do not have
any preference.&nbsp; It is entirely upto the volunteer to choose a text
to add to the library.&nbsp; While we do not have any strict preference,
we suggest that Tamil works in the brink of extinction be archived, if
possible.&nbsp; Even today, it is a sad fact that there exist innumerable
Tamil books and literature, which are ignored and nearly out of print.&nbsp;
If we can preserve these treasures, it will be of great service to the
future generation.</p>
<a NAME="2.6"></a><b>2.6&nbsp;
I think old Tamil classic works should be given preference.&nbsp; Why do
I find some recent works in the collection ?</b>

<p>We entirely agree with your opinion and do
give priority coverage to all ancient works that are at risk of being lost. But
we like to remind you that Project Madurai is conceived as a "Tamil Digital
Library on the Net", built  entirely as a voluntary effort.&nbsp; 
Therefore, we do not force volunteers
to take up old classics, but rather leave it to their wishes.&nbsp; However
a good number of volunteers also share your opinion and have brought in
a good collection of old Tamil classics to the collection.</p>
<a NAME="2.7"></a><b>2.7&nbsp;
I do not see many works by recent (or popular) authors.&nbsp; Why isn't
this so ?</b>
<p>This may
be true. You do not see many recent works, because they are copyrighted.&nbsp;

Some authors were kind enought to release their works and this makes up
the few recent works in the collection.&nbsp; It may be pointed out here that
Tamilnadu Govt. has placed the literary works of several distinguished Tamil 
authors in public domain, after paying some royalties to family members. 
For a list of authors, see the <a href=target.html> webpage on target works </a>.
See also <a href="#2.5">Question 2.5</a>.</p>
<a NAME="2.8"></a><b>2.8&nbsp;
I see religious texts in the collection ? Why is this so ?</b>
<p>Project
Madurai collection is truly a digital library.&nbsp; There is no distinction
between a religious and non-religious text. The works were brought in the
collection by volunteers and are part of our collection.</p>

<a NAME="2.9"></a><b>2.9&nbsp;
Where can I see the list of archived collection ?&nbsp; Is there a list
of pending works to be done ?</b>
<p>To facilitate visitors, we have put up a catalogue of etexts archived at Project Madurai: <a href="pmworks.html">a chronological/alphabetical release list</a> <br>
 </p>
<a NAME="2.10"></a><b>2.10&nbsp;
How many members are there in this project ?</b>
<p>Presently
there are about 200 volunteers in this project.</p>
<a NAME="2.11"></a><b>2.11&nbsp;

Who manages this project ?&nbsp; Who are the coordinators ?</b>
<p>Project
Madurai is lead by <a href="mailto:pmadurai AT gmail DOT com?subject=projectmadurai">Dr. K. Kalyanasundaram</a> and 
<a href="mailto:pmadurai AT gmail DOT com?subject=projectmadurai">Dr. P. Kumar Mallikarjunan</a>.&nbsp;
You can also find a list of coordinators in <a href="volunteers.html">this
page</a>.</p>
<a NAME="2.12"></a><b>2.12&nbsp;

I live in ABCD town.&nbsp; Is there anyone near my town to contact and
know more about this ?</b>
<p>We suggest
you take a look at the <a href="volunteers.html">list of coordinators.</a>
This list is not complete and so does not have all the present volunteers'
name.&nbsp; Send a mail to the Project Madurai group - most probably there
is someone located near your town.</p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><a NAME="3"></a> 3.&nbsp;  Other Questions</b>

<p><a NAME="3.1"></a><b>3.1&nbsp;
I have access to a scanner.&nbsp; Can I just scan pages and add it to the
collection ?</b>
<p>Scanned
pages take up a lot of space and so at present, we do not have any scanned
work in our collection.</p>
<a NAME="3.2"></a><b>3.2&nbsp;
Does not Tamil have a OCR program to simplify these tasks ?</b>
<p>We wish
Tamil had a good Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program that can tremendously
help in converting scanned texts to electronic texts.&nbsp; Unfortunately
there is not yet a Tamil OCR program and so we need volunteers to type
in the texts.&nbsp; Moreover even if we had a Tamil OCR,&nbsp; we still
need to manually proof-read the texts.&nbsp; This is because OCRs are not
exactly 100 % accurate and so we still need volunteers for this project.</p>

<a NAME="3.3"></a><b>3.3&nbsp;
How about copyright issues ?</b>

<p>Project
Madurai strictly adheres to copyright standards.&nbsp; All the works in
the collection are either from public-domain (after a certain period of
their creation, currently ca. 75 years after the lifespan of the author) or with due consent from the respective authors.</p>
<a NAME="3.4"></a><b>3.4&nbsp;
I have a suggestion.&nbsp; Whom can I contact ?</b>
<p>Feel free
to send a mail to <a href="mailto:pmadurai AT gmail DOT com?subject=projectmadurai">Dr. Kalyanasundaram </a>.

They will be glad to hear your suggestion or opinions, if any.</p>
