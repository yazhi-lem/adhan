Kalevala the national epic of Finland: An introduction

By Asko Parpola (University of Helsinki)

Kalevala and the ancient Finnish folk poetry

Kalevala, the Finnish national epic  and  one  of  the  great  heroic  poems  of  world  literature,  took  its
definitive shape in 1849, but it is directly based on oral poetry that mainly came into being during the
first millennium of the Christian era. The work was compiled by the great philologist Elias Lonnrot
(1802-1884) from the best and most complete variants of ancient folk songs that he himself and other
pioneers of Finnish folklore had collected in the backwoods of Karelia.

Karelia, a vast area now mainly on the Russian side of Finland's eastern border, formed a periphery of
Finnish-Karelian  culture  that  was  cut  off  from  the  centres  of  civilization  by  long  distances  and
scarcely  inhabited  forests.  The  old  folk  poetry  was  preserved  there  in  an  oral  tradition  until  the
nineteenth and even twentieth century, because the Orthodox Church prevailing in Russia was more
tolerant than the Roman Catholic Church current in other parts of Finland until the reformation and the
Lutheran Christianity, which after the reformation systematically worked for the eradication of pagan
traditions  in  Finland.  While  Kalevala  on  the  whole  reflects  the  pre-Christian  religion  and  heroic
legends of the Finnish-speaking peoples, its last canto has as its theme  the  triumph  of  Christianity,
which the Swedish conquerors forced onto Finland in AD 1155.

Mikeal Agricola's translation of New Testament, printed in 1548, is the oldest directly surviving book
in  the  Finnish  language.  Very  short  samples  of  the  closely  related  Karelian  language  are  three
centuries older; they consist of spells written on birchbark, found near the Russian city of Novgorod.
The folk  poems,  though  collected  only  in  the  nineteenth  century,  largely  go  back  to  pre-Christian
times, come from widely different areas and comprise a great bulk of material; they are thus, in effect,
among  the  most  important  monuments  relating  to  the  early  stages  of  the  Finnish  language  and
religion.

Comparative linguistics has shown Finnish to be an offshoot of the Uralic  language  family,  whose
speakers  nowadays  number  in  all  about  twenty  million  (the  principal  languages  being  Hungarian,
Finnish and Estonian, with fourteen, five and one million speakers respectively; the other languages
are  spoken  by  small  minorities  in  Russia).  I  shall  briefly  discuss  this  linguistic  background  of
Kalevala also because there are interesting connections with Indian languages.

Genetic relationship between the Uralic and Dravidian languages?

Speakers of the Proto-Uralic language livied around 6000-4000 BC as hunters and fishermen in the
forest regions of the northeastern Europe, on both sides of Ural mountains. While the Samoyeds of
Siberia  represent  the  eastern  branch  of  the  Uralic  language  family,  the  Proto-Finno-Ugrians,  who
lived about 4000-2500 BC in central Russia, form its western branch.

The Uralic language family (or rather its Finno-Ugric branch) has repeatedly been mentioned among
the most distant relatives of the Dravidian language family. Indeed, several among the most famous
Dravidologists, such as Robert Caldwell (who spoke of Scythian languages), Thomas Burrow  (1943-
46)  and  M.S.Andronov,  have  been  supporters  of  this  hypothesis.  Being  a  Finnish  student  of
Dravidian, I naturally took an interest in this question, and years ago accumulated a lot of material for
a  book  on  the  subject.  I  never  finished  the  work,  however,  because  I  became  convinced  of  the

6

impossibility of proving by linguistics means any genetic relationship as distant as it is  in  this  case
assumed  to  be.  Genetic  affinity  can  be  proved  only  by  means  of  establishing  regular  phonetic
correspondences between the two protolanguages, and to be able to do this in a convincing manner
that allows some crosschecking, one needs atleast about one hundred good etyma. In other words, to
start with, one needs minimally a hundred word pairs that on both sides can be reconstructed for the
protolanguages  and  in  which  the  respective  reconstruction  resemble  each  other  reasonably  closely
both phonetically and semantically. As the reconstruction of the Uralic family itself is based on only
about 140 accepted etymologists shared  by  both  Proto-Finno-Urgic  and  Proto-Samoyedic  (Janhunen
1981), one cannot a priori expect the number of etyma surviving from an even older hypothetic Uralo-
Dravidian phylum to be much  more  than  around  20,  which  would  be  much  too  few  to  prove  the
hypothesis.  This  does  not,  of  course,  disprove  the  hypothesis  -  after  all,  it  is  possible  that  all
languages are ultimately related: L.L.Cavalli-Sforza has recently compared their tentative family tree to
the spread of human populations around the globe as deduced by biology.

(One paragraph omitted here due to difficulties in typing characters with special diacritical markers.)

In addition, the Proto-Uralic and Proto-Dravidian resemble each other typologically in  a  number  of
features, such as the agglutinative morphology and the relatively simple syllable structure (no initial
consonant  clusters).  Even  some  grammatical  morphemes  are  similar:  *n  as  the  possessive  (U)  or
oblique case (Dr) marker, or *i as a past tense marker (on the Uralic side in Proto-Finno-Ugric only:
the Samoyedic verbal suffix *y does not seem to mark any tense).

Ancient contacts between Finno-Ugrians and early Aryans

The  Proto-Finno-Ugrians,  who  lived  about  4000-2500  BC  in  the  forests  of  central  Russia,  had  as
their neighbours in the steppes of southern Russia the speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language
(c.  4500-2800  BC),  and  then  the  speakers  of  one  of  its  daughter  languages,  the  Proto-Aryans  (c.
2800-2000),  whose  descendents  brought  Sanskrit  to  India  soon  after  2000  BC.  (Parpola  in  press.)
The  Finnish  language  preserves  some  ancient  Aryan  loanwords,  such  as  'sata'  `hundred`,  nearly
identical  with  the  corresponding  Sanskrit  word  sata  `hundred`.  It  is  possible  that  even  the  early
Finnish religion was influenced by Aryan ideas. Thus the principal Finnish word for `god`, jumala,
may come from the ancient Aryan word dyumat `shining`, which the Rgvedic hymns apply to Indra,
the god of war and thunder. Indra occupied the highest position in the ancient Indo-Aryan pantheon
as  did  Ukko,  the  god  of  thunder,  among  the  ancient  Finnish  deities.  Another  example  is  the
miraculous mill in Kalevala, called  sampo  (colour  plate  2).  Its  standing  epithet  `having  a  speckled
cover`  suggested  that  the  idea  of  this  wonder-mill  may  have  come  from  the  star-speckled  cosmic
`mill` of the revolving heavens. The word sampohas a variant form, sammas, which means `pillar`,
and this in turn suggests a relationship with Sanskrit skambha or stambha, which occurs in the Veda
as the name for the cosmic pillar that upholds the sky.

Proto-Finns and Lapps

By the first millennium BC at the latest, the Balto-Finnic offshoot of the Uralic language family had
reached the Baltic region and Finland and divided into two major branches. Proto-Lapps occupied the
northern  areas,  probably  most  parts  of  Finland,  while  Proto-Finns  (whose  present-day  linguistic
descendents include the speakers of Estonian, Finnish and Karelian) were settled in Estonia, Karelia
and southernmost Finland. The poems of Kalevala belong to  the  Proto-Finnish  branch.  The  Proto-
Finns were engaged in primitive farming and had a more advanced material culture, which they had
adopted - along with loanwords and ideas - from the neighbouring Indo-European-speaking peoples,
including Germanic (Nordic or Scandinavian), Baltic (Latvian and Lithuanian) and Slavic  (Russian)

7

tribes. The songs of Kalevala reflect the northward expansion of the Proto-Finns and  their  hostility
towards  the  Lapps,  their  linguistic  relatives,  who  nowadays  survive  as  a  small  minority  in  the
northernmost fringes of Scandinavia near the Artic Ocean. Traditionally the Lapps have been hunters
and nomadic reindeer herders. It is probably the Lapps that the Roman author Tacitus meant in AD
98. When in his description of the northernmost borders of Europe he spoke of a people called Fenni
who lived by hunting and food-gathering, with no permanent homes.

Contents of Kelavala

The war expeditions of Kalevala, which also have as their historical background the Viking raids of
the late first millennium A.D., form the backbone of the poems, as does war between the Paandavas
and the Kauravaas in the Mahaabhaarata, or Raama's expedition to Lanka in the Raamaayana. But the
poems  are  by  no  means  limited  to  warring  themes.  Wooing  with  physical  feats  of  the  would-be-
groom,  is  another  popular  heroic  theme,  comparable  to  the  svayamvaras  of  the  Indian  epics.  The
Kalevala poems also deal with many other aspects of everyday life like  agriculture  (see  fig.  2)  and
herding  (colour  plate  6),  and  all  kinds  of  folk  customs  like  marriage  and  healing  rituals,  or  the
pastimes  of  the  youth,  and,  of  course,  with  the  world  view  and  religion.  One  gets  a  fairly
comprehensive description of the ancient Finnish culture, somewhat in the manner that all the facets of
ancient Tamil culture are presented in Cilappatikaaram (we must not forget, however, that the Finnish
culture was completely rural and much simpler than the sophisticated and largely urban culture of the
Tamils).  The  most  ancient  religion  of  the  peoples  speaking  Uralic  languages  was  probably
shamanistic, but the religion reflected in Kalevala has been much influenced by the other peoples with
whom the Baltic Finns had been in contact. In fact there are many world views  in  Kalevala:  myths
going back to the Stone Age, like the poems of creation  and  the  felling  of  the  grat  oak  (discussed
below), legends connected  with  the  adventurers  of  the  Viking  Age  and  with  Chirstianity,  and  the
poems by farmers, shamans and women.

The great oak and its felling

As an illustration of Kalevala's contents I would like to discuss in some detail the second  song,  which
follows upon the myth of the world's creation in the first song. The wise sage Va*ina*mo*inen wants
to have trees sown upon the bare islands and mainland that rise from the primeval ocean. This is done
by the spirit guarding the fertility of  the  soil,  Sampsa  Pellervoinen.  The  seeds  of  all  trees  flourish
excepting that of the oak. Only after the demigods of the sea burn some hay  and  an  acorn  falls  on
these ashes, does the oak start to grow. But it grows up to the sky, into an enormous tree that prevents
the sun and the moon from shining. The whole world is doomed to darkness. Va*ina*mo*inen looks
in vain for a feller for the giant tree, and finally prays to his mother, the maiden of the sea. She sends a
tiny man, of the length of a thumb, whose appearance makes Va*ina*mo*inen laugh and ridicule him,
rather like the demon Bali who was misled by the looks of God Visnu in his dwarf incarnation. Just
like  Vamana,  howver,  the  little  coppery  man  (undoubtedly  a  personification  of  the  ruddy  rising
morning sun) suddenly grows into an enormous size and fells the terrible tree by hitting it three times
with his axe. Nature is now freed from the evil of darkness and starts to blossom. (One is reminded
of the relief of the world when god Indra destroyed the demon 'Vrtra' and released all the waters that
this monster had been retaining.) Splinters of the fallen oak scatter happiness throughout the world.
This last mentioned motif seems to be connected with rituals of brewing beer around the central oak in
the sacred grove, and of making beer cups out of oak wood, which had magic powers. The rest of the
song describes swidden agriculture, the normal method of cultivation in  ancient  times,  which  is  no
longer in use (in fact it is prohibited): it invloves cutting all trees  in  a  large  area  and  burning  them
before the seed is sown in the ashes. (Fig. 2.) Va*ina*mo*inen saves, however, one birch tree for the
cuckoo bird to sit on.

Kalevala

The name Kalevala ends in the Finnish place name suffix  -la.  The  remining  stem  Kaleva  has  been
understood  as  the  proper  name  of  the  most  ancient  ancestor  of  the  Finns,  who  had  twelve  sons,
among them such heroes of Kalevala as Vainamoinen  and  Ilmarinen.  In  Finnish,  the  word  Kaleva
occurs  in  several  names  of  stars  (  the  belt  of  Orion  is  called  `the  sword  of  Kaleva`)  and  other
heavenly phenomena like thunderbolts (`fires of Kaleva`), and the sons  of  Kaleva  are  said  to  have
been giants who destroyed forests as superpowerful masters of swidden agriculture (where trees are
burnt to make fields, fig. 2). The etymology of the name is uncertain, but the most likely explanation
connects it with the Lithunian word 'kalvis' `smith` and the ancient Baltic smith god Kalevias.

Ilmarinen, the divine smith

One of the principal heroes of Kalevala, Ilmarinen, is specifically a smith. Among his main feats are
the taming of iron, the forging of the miraculous mill sampo (colour plate 2), ploughing a field full of
vipers (colour plate 5), the making of a golden maiden and releasing the heavenly lights from the rock
of the north. In ancient folk poems Ilmarinen has  forged  the  heavenly  vault  as  well  as  the  sampo.
Depicted on a  shamanic  drum  from  Lapland  dating  from  1692  is  an  anthropomorphic  god,  called
Ilmaris, who is said  to  regulate  the  air  and  the  wind.  The  Finnish  word  ilma  means  `air`  and  the
Votyaks living in Russia still worship a sky god called Inmar or Ilmar.

Va*ina*mo*inen and the power of songs

The main actor of Kalevala, Va*ina*mo*inen, is a  many-sided  figure  with  both  divine  and  human
features. Lo*nnrot seems to have favoured the latter at the expense of mythological characteristics. In
the first song he is the creator god born in the primeval sea, and also his name, derived from va*ina*
meaning `a broad, deep and slow-flowing river` suggets that originally he  might  have  been  a  deity
connected with waters, somewhat like Varuna in the Indian mythology. Va*ina*mo*inen also acts as
a culture hero: he is the first builder of a boat and the first maker of a zither, who enchants the entire
nature with his music. Va*ina*mo*inen's epithets emphasis his age and wisdom: he is a mighty sage
possessed  of  supermundane  knowledge,  who  performs  his  feats  by  means  of  magic  songs  and
powerful words. Like a shaman, he descends to the netherworld to fetch the missing mantras from a
dead ancient giant. Although Va*ina*mo*inen often appears as a warrior, his capacities as a fighter
are not appreciated nearly as much as is his knowledge. It is interesting to note in this connection that
the  Finnish  word  for  `hero`,  'sankari',  goes  back  to  the  Old  Nordic  word  'sangare'  `singer`.  In  a
singing contest, Va*ina*mo*inen's mighty words make his adversary sink into  a  swamp.  Different
scholars  have  come  forward  with  widely  different  and  controversial  results  in  their  efforts  to
comprehend in simplistic terms the character of  Va*ina*mo*inen.  The  same  applies  to  many  other
figures of Kalevala. A similar situation prevails in the study of the Indian epics: the five Pandavas,  for
instance, have been interpreted as incarnations of various deities already in ancient times, while other
scholars take them to be historical human heroes.

Elias Lo*nnrot

Although Kalevala is based on ancient folk songs, we must  not  forget  that  its  compiler  also  has  a
considerable share in its formation. It remains the work of Elias Lo*nnrot (1802-1884), son  of  a  poor
villiage tailor, who started his career as a medical doctor, but who became a Professor of the Finnish
language with as extraordinarily wide range of cultural activities. On elven long treks through largely
roadless  wildernesses,  Lo*nnrot  travelled  by  foot  some  twenty  thousand  kilometers  and  collected

9

about 65,000 lines of Kalevala-type folk songs. After a  doctoral  dissertation  on  the  poems  dealing
with  Va*ina*mo*inen  (1822),  he  published  the  first  edition  of  Kalevala,  the  so  calleed  "Old
Kalevala", in 1835; the second and final edition, nearly twice the length of  the  first,  comprising  50
songs and 22,795 lines in all, came out in 1849. An anthology of lyric folk poetry called Kanteletar
was  published  by  Lo*nnrot  in  1840-41.  The  original  sources  of  these  publications  still  exist,  and
afford a clear idea of its relationship to the genuine folklore. Lonnrot gave Kalevala its overall shape
and structure, and in linking the various originally independent episodes composed himself about 600
lines which have no parallel in the folk material.

A  large  body  of  the  original  folk  poetry  on  which  Kalevala  and  Kanteletar  are  based  has  been
published in 33 thick volumes of Suomen kansan vanhat runot (`The ancient poems  of  the  Finnish
people`) in 1908-1948. Even this huge work does not exhaust the rich collections  that  hundreds  of
scholars and volunteer collectors of folklore have accumulated in the archives of the Finnish Literature
Society. Established in 1831, the Finnish Literature Society is one of oldest and largest collections of
oral tradition in the world. In 1977, these collections comprised some 86,800 songs in Kalevala metre;
129,400 rhymed folk-songs; 52,400 incantations; 336,000 spells, beliefs and omens; 187,400 games;
9,300 nonsense verse and laments; 96,000 fairy tales; 1,600 religious legends; 103,200 supernatural
tales and memorates; 77,800 historical and local tales; 7,700 aetiological stories and myths; 766,500
proverbs (complemented by  1,425,000  proverb  variants  in  the  collections  of  Helsinki  University);
117,300 riddles; 23,200 folk tunes; and 54,000 ethnographic descriptions.

Kalevala as the national epic of the Finns

Lo*nnrot's work, particularly the publication of Kalevala, had an immerse effect on the self-awareness
and national feeling of the Finns, who had been dominated by the Swedes from  1155  to  1809  and
then (after a war between Sweden and Russia, which Sweden  lost)  by  the  Russians  from  1809  to
1917, when Finland finally obtained independence. Lo*nnrot's service to world literature in salvaging
the  ancient  heritage  from  the  destruction  can  be  compared  with  that  rendered  by  the  famous
resurrector  of  the  Old  Tamil  Cankam  literature,  Uu.  Vee.  Caaminaathaiyar.  The  famous  Finnish
composer Jean Sibelius (1865-1957) introduced many themes of Kalevala to world music. His music
has in the hearts of the Finns a position comparable to the music of Thiyaagaraajar among the Tamils.
The poems of Kalevala have greatly inspired also the greatest Finnish visual artists, above all Akseli
Gallen-Kallela (1865-1931). The vignettes at the beginning and end of  each  poem  have  been  taken
from his artistic Kalevala edition,  and  a  small  selection  of  his  Kalevala  paintings  and  frescoes  are
reproduced in the frontispiece and on the eight colour plates. It is hoped that  they  can  also  mediate
some impression of Finnish  nature,  still  today  characterized  by  lakes  and  forests;  they  render  this
artist's view of the cultural milieu that created the poems.

The Tamil translation by Mr. R. Sivalingam

Oxford  University  Press  has  recently  published  a  new  English  translation  of  Kalevala  by  Keith
Bosley in its series `The World's Classics` (1989). This translation, the earlier English renderings by
W.F.Kirby (1907, reprinted in Gallen-Kallela 1985) and F.B.Magoun, Jr. (1963), together with some
other English translations have been taken into consideration in the present Tamil interpretation. The
translator,  Mr  R.  Sivalingam  of  Jaffna,  Sri  Lanka,  is  an  experiened  writer  well  known  to  Tamil
readers through his numerous novels and short stories published under the pen name Udayanan. His
two  novels  Ponnaana  malarallavoo  and  An-taranka  kiitam  were  published  by  the  Express
Newspapers (Ceylon) Ltd. in Colombo in their series of `Virakesari  Publications`.  Having  lived  in
Finland for more than ten years, he has become acquainted with the Finnish culture and language and
has  been  able  to  base  his  rendering  of  Kalevala  directly  on  the  Finnish-Karelian  original.  He  has

10

carefully  polished  its  form  with  the  help  of  his  Sri  Lankan  poet  friend,  S.  Krishnapillai
(`Thimilaithumilan`).

Naturally, it has been impossible to retain all the poetic peculiarties of the original. The Kalevala metre
consists basically of trochaic tetrametres (-v / -v / -v / -v ), with two such lines usually forming a pair:
the second line repeats in different words the message conveyed by the first line. Instead of rhyme at
the end of the line, there is often alliteration: two or more words within a line  begin  with  the  same
sound. It has been possible to imitate this latter device in the Tamil translation. Compare the Finnish
original and the Tamil translation of the initial verses of the work reproduced below:

  Mieleni minun tekevi, 
  aivoni ajattelevi, 
  la*htea*ni laulamahan, 
  saa ani sanelemahan, 
  sukuvirtta* suoltamahan,
  lajivirtta* laulamahan. 
  Sanat suussani sulavat,

These initial lines contain typical stock phrases with which the  folk  singers  used  to  introduce  their
performance. It was common for two persons to sing together, hand in hand (fig. 3), slowly rocking
their bodies from side to side. Musical accompaniment was provided with a zither, called kantele (fig.
4).  The  Kalevala  type  poetry  was  sung  in  simple  melodies  known  in  two  main  varieties  (fig.  5).
Though the melodies are simple, the best singers could vary and repeat them in so many  ways  that
they never seemed monotonous.

Of course, the translation of a work reflecting a totally different geographic and cultural milieu from
that of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka has posed many problems. Let us remember that snow and skiing,
for example, were totally unfamiliar to the Tamils before the development of modern communication.
And how to render the names of plants and berries not growing in southern Asia? All such problems
could perhaps not be fully solved, but  the  Tamil  reader  is  given  additional  information  concerning
proper names and problematic expressions (marked in the translation with single and double asterisks
respectively) in the glossaries and explanations at the end of the work.

I know Tamils to be avid readers and consumers of culture, who are proud to possess great epics of
much the same age as the Kalevala poetry: the Cilappathikaaram, MaNimeekalai, Ciivakacin-thamaNi
and Kampa-raamaayaNam. I am convinced that they will appreciate the service done by R. Sivalingam
to  the  cause  of  Tamil  culture  and  literature  as  he  has  enriched  it  with  a  direct  and  outstanding
rendering of one of the great epics of the world, just as we Finns feel happy that our ancient heritage
can now reach lovers of good literature on the other side of the globe. Tamil is now the 30th language
into which Kalevala has so far been translated in its entirety; abbreviated translations have been made
into a dozen or so further languages.

Supporters of the project

The  Department  of  Asian  and  African  Studies  at  the  University  of  Helsinki  (this  writer)  and  the
Finnish Literature Society (Secretary General, Mr Urpo Vento) have coordinated the applications for
financial  support  to  the  Tamil  Kalevala  project.  We  gratefully  acknowledge  the  schlorship  to  Mr
Sivalingam and  a  very  substantial  subsidy  covering  most  of  the  printing  expenses  that  have  been
granted by the Finnish Ministry of Education; special thanks are due to Mr Kalervo Siikala and Mr
Matti Gustafson, the Director and Assistant Director of the Department of International Affairs, and
to Ms Marita Savola, Counsellor of Educational Affairs. The special employment funds administrated
by the City of Helsinki and the University of Helsinki have also been a most important resource for
the  translation.  Ms  Aivi  Gallen-Kallela  and  her  husband  Dr  Matti  Siren,  Werner  Soderstrom
Osakeyhtio (WSOY) and its Managing Director, Dr Jorma Kaimio, and former Director Mr Hannu
Tarmio, and Mr Taumo  Homma,  Manager  WSOY's  Printing  plant  in  Porvoo,  have  all  been  most
helpful in matters concerning Akseli Gallen-Kallela's Kaleval illustrations. Mr Sivalingam has himself
taken  care  of  the  typesetting  and  proofreading  of  the  Tamil  text,  and  of  the  translation  of  this
introduction.  Mr  Petteri  Koskikallio  has  been  of  great  help  in  the  finalization  of  the  layout.  We
cordially thank Mr Kaarlo Schepel, Director of the Alternative Press, Hong Kong,  for  publishing  this
translation in an attractive manner and securing its distribution at a price that should be within in the
reach of the literature loving Tamils.
