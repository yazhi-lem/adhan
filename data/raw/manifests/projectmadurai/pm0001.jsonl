து\nஅடிப்படையில் ஒரு வாழ்வியல் நூல். மனித வாழ்வின் முக்கிய அங்கங்களாகிய அறம்\nஅல்லது  தர்மம்,  பொருள்,   ன்பம்  அல்லது  காமம்  ஆகியவற்றைப்  பற்றி  விளக்கும்\nநூல்.\n\n ந்நூலை   யற்றியவர்  திருவள்ளுவர்.   வருடைய   யற்பெயர்  என்ன\nஎன்பதுவும்  மேற்கொண்ட  விபரங்களும்  சாிவரத்தொியவில்லை.   வரைப்பற்றிச்\nசெவிவழிமரபாகச்  சில  செய்திகள்  விளங்குகின்றன.  ஆனால்  அறுதியான  வரலாறு\nகிடையாது. அந்தச் செய்திகளின் வாயிலாகப்பெறும் தகவல்களின்படி,  வர் வள்ளுவ\nமரபைச்சேர்ந்தவர்  என்றும்,  மயிலாப்பூாில்  வசித்தவர்  என்றும்  தொிகிறது;\n வருடைய மனைவியார் வாசுகி அம்மையார்.கற்பியலுக்கு மிகச்சிறந்த  லக்கணமாக\nவிளங்கியவர்.  வள்ளுவர்  தாம்  எழுதிய  முப்பால்  நூலை  தமிழ்ச்சங்கத்தில்\nஅரங்கேற்றம்  செய்ய  மிகவும்  சிரமப்பட்டதாகவும்,  முடிவில்  ஒளவையாாின்\nதுணையோடு  அரங்கேற்றியதாகவும்  அச்செய்திகள்  வாயிலாக  அறிகிறோம்.\nதிருவள்ளுவரை  நாயனார்,  தேவர்,  தெய்வப்புலவர்,  பெருநாவலர்,  பொய்யில்  புலவர்\nஎன்றும் சில சிறப்புப்பெயர்களால் அழைப்பர்.\n\nபிற்காலத்தில்  திருவள்ளுவர்  பெயரால்  வேறு  சிலநூல்களை  வேறு  சிலர்\n யற்றியுள்ளனர்.  அவை  சித்தர்   லக்கியத்தைச்  சேர்ந்தவை. \n  திருக்குறள்\n யற்றப்பட்ட  காலம்   ன்னும்  சாியாக  வரையறுக்கப்படவில்லை.      கிருதுவ\nசகாப்தத்தின் முன் பகுதியைச் சேர்ந்ததாகப் பலர் கருதுவர்.\n\nபழந்தமிழ் நூல்களில் நான்கு பெரும் பகுப்புக்கள் உள்ளன.\n    1.எட்டுத்தொகை,பத்துப்பாட்டு ஆகியவை அடங்கிய பதினென்மேல்கணக்கு\n    2.பதினென்கீழ்க்கணக்கு\n    3.ஐம்பெருங்காப்பியங்கள்\n    4.ஐஞ்சிறு காப்பியங்கள்\nஆகியவை  அவை.  அவற்றில்  பதினென்கீழ்க்கணக்கு  எனப்படும்  பதினெட்டு\nநூல்களின் வாிசையில் \"முப்பால்\" என்னும் பெயரோடு  ந்நூல் விளங்குகின்றது.\n\n  \"அறம்,  பொருள்,   ன்பம்\",  ஆகிய  மூன்று  பால்களும்  கொண்டமையால்\n\"முப்பால்\"  எனப்  பெயர்  பெற்றது.  முப்பால்களாகிய  ஆகிய   வை  ஒவ்வொன்றும்\n\" யல்\"  என்னும்  பகுதிகளாக  மேலும்  பகுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.  ஒவ்வொரு   யலும்  சில\nகுறிப்பிட்ட அதிகாரங்களைக் கொண்டதாக விளங்குகின்றது. ஒவ்வொரு அதிகாரமும்\nபத்துபாடல்களைத் தன்னுள் அடக்கியது.\n\n ப்பாடல்கள் அனைத்துமே குறள் வெண்பா என்னும் வெண்பா வகையைச்\nசேர்ந்தவை.   வ்வகை  வெண்பாக்களால்  ஆகிய  அக்காலத்திய  முதல்  நூலும்  ஒரே\nநூலும்   துதான்.    குறள்  வெண்பாக்களால்  ஆனமையால்  \"குறள்'  என்றும்\n\"திருக்குறள்\" என்றும்  து பெயர் பெற்றது.\n\n\"பாயிரம்\"  என்னும்  பகுதியுடன்  முதலில்  \"அறத்துப்பால்\"  வருகிறது.\nஅதிலும்  முதலில்  காணப்படுவது  ,  \"கடவுள்  வாழ்த்து\"  என்னும்  அதிகாரம்.\nதொடர்ந்து,  \"வான்  சிறப்பு\",  \"நீத்தார்  பெருமை\",  \"அறன்  வலியுறுத்தல்\",  ஆகிய\n\n\f4\n\nஅதிகாரங்கள்.    அடுத்துவரும்  \" ல்லறவியல்\"  என்னும்   யலில்  25  அதிகாரங்கள்;\nஅடுத்துள்ள  துறவறவியலில்  13  அதிகாரங்களுடன்  முதற்பாலாகிய  அறத்துப்பால்\nபகுதி முடிவுறுகிறது. அடுத்து வரும் \"பொருட்பாலி\"ல் அரசு  யல், அமைச்சு  யல்,\nஒழிபு   யல்  ஆகிய   யல்கள்   ருக்கின்றன.  அரசு   யலில்  25  அதிகாரங்கள்\nஉள்ளன. அமைச்சு  யலில் 32 அதிகாரங்களும், ஒழிபு  யலில் 13 அதிகாரங்களும்\nஉள்ளன.  கடைசிப்பாலாகிய \" ன்பத்துப்பால்\" அல்லது \"காமத்துப்பாலி\"ல்  ரண்டு\n யல்கள்;  களவியலில்  7  அதிகாரங்களும்,  கற்பியலில்  18  அதிகாரங்களும்  உள்ளன.\nஆகமொத்தம் 7  யல்கள்; 133 அதிகாரங்கள்; 1330 பாடல்கள்.\n\nதிருக்குறளை  மொத்தம்  12000  சொற்களில்  வள்ளுவர்  பாடியுள்ளார்.\n\nஆனால்  வற்றில் ஐம்பதுக்கும் குறைவான வடசொற்களே உள்ளன.\n              \"அகரம் முதல வெழுத்தெல்லாம் ஆதி\n              பகவன் முதற்றே யுலகு....\"\nஎன்று தமிழ் நெடுங்கணக்கின் முதல் எழுத்தாகிய \"அ\" வில் ஆரம்பித்து, 1330 ஆம்\nகுறளாகிய,\n              \"ஊடுதல் காமத்திற்கின்பம்; அதற்கின்பம்,\n              கூடி முயங்கப்பெறின்\"\nஎன்று தமிழ் மொழியின் கடைசி எழுத்தாகிய \"ன்\" னுடன் முடித்திருக்கிறார்.\n\nவாழ்வியலின்  எல்லா  அங்கங்களையும்  திருக்குறள்  கூறுவதால்,  அதைச்\nசிறப்பித்துப்  பல  பெயர்களால்  அழைப்பர்:  திருக்குறள்,  முப்பால்,  உத்தரவேதம்,\nதெய்வநூல்,  பொதுமறை,  பொய்யாமொழி,  வாயுறை  வாழ்த்து,  தமிழ்  மறை,\nதிருவள்ளுவம் என்ற பெயர்கள் அதற்குாியவை.\n\nபழங்காலத்தில்   தற்குப்  பலர்  உரை  எழுதியுள்ளனர்.  அவற்றில்  புகழ்\nவாய்ந்ததாக  விளங்குவதும்  அதிகமாகப்  பயன்படுத்தப்பட்டதும்  பாிமேலழகர்\nஉரைதான்.  தற்காலத்திலும்  பலர்  உரை  எழுதியுள்ளனர்.  அவற்றில்  தற்சமயம்\nசிறப்பாகக் கருதப் படுவது திருக்குறள் முனுசாமியின் உரை.\n\nதனிமனிதனுக்கு  உாிமையானது   ன்பவாழ்வு;  அதற்குத்  துணையாக\nஉள்ளது  பொருளியல்  வாழ்வு;  அவற்றிற்கெல்லாம்  அடிப்படையாக  விளங்குவது\nஅறவாழ்வு.  மனதே  எல்லாவற்றிற்கும்  ஆதார  நிலைக்கலன்;  மனத்துக்கண்  மாசிலன்\nஆதலே  அனைத்து  அறம்;  அறத்தால்  வருவதே   ன்பம்.  அறவழியில்  நின்று  பொருள்\nஈட்டி,  அதனைக்கொண்டு   ன்பவாழ்வு  வாழ  வேண்டும்.  அவ்வாறு  உலகமாந்தரும்\n ன்பமுறச்  செய்யவேண்டும்.  பொருளியலாகிய  பொதுவாழ்வுக்கும்   ன்ப   யலாகிய\nதனிவாழ்வுக்கும் அடிப்படை அறம்தான் என்பது திருக்குறளின் மொத்தமான நோக்கு.\n\nஉலகிலேயே  அதிக  மொழிகளில்  மொழிபெயர்க்கப்பட்டுள்ள  நூல்களில்\nமூன்றாம்   டத்தைத்  திருக்குறள்  வகிக்கிறது.   துவரை  80  மொழிகளில்  மொழி\nபெயர்க்கப்பட்டுள்ளது.\n       \" றைவன்
